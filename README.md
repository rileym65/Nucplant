A long time ago in a magazine called 80-Micro There was nuclear power plant simulation project. 
This project consisted of building a hardware panel that contained the warning lights and power 
plant controls and a BASIC program provided the simulation.  It was a really cool thing, but
too expensive for me to build way back in the day.

At one point I converted the BASIC program to C on Linux and used X-Windows as the interface,
using graphics and on-screen widget controls to replace the hardware panel used in the original
simulation in 80-Micro.

Recently I decided to port the code to C# on Windows, which is this project.  There is a document
detailing how to get the power plant up and running and a simple scoring system to make a small
game out of it.
