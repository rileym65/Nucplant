Startup:
========
1. Press all three RCP buttons, this will turn them green.
2. Watch Pri-Flow Rate meter.  "LOW PRIMARY FLOW RATE" warning will go out when flow rate hits 99%
3. Open FV1 through FV3 about 1/5.
4. Watch the S/G 1% through S/G 3% meters, when the needle is out of the red, close the valve for each Steam Generator.  When all 3 steam generators the "LO S/G LEVEL" warning light will go out.
5. Turn off AFP 1 and AFP 2, these will both turn green and the "AUX FEED" warning light will go out.
6. Press the "Rx" button to reset the rector.  The "Rx TRIP" warning will go out.
7. Press the OUT button to start pulling out the control rolds.  The button will turn red.
8. Watch the primary and secondary temperature and pressure meters, when all 4 are out of the red, press the OUT button to stop pulling out the control rods, the button will turn green.
9. Press the Turbine button to reset the turbine, the button will turn green and the "TURBINE TRIP" warning will turn off.
10. Adjust the RPM control until the Turbin RPM meter shows the needle between the red zones.  The Sync light will turn green.
11. Press the Grid button to attach the power plant to the grid, the button will turn green.

At this point all buttons should be green, there should be no red warnings, except for possibly "STEAM/FEED MISMATCH"

Scoring:
========
Each second your average MW will be added to your score.  If your plant is operating at 600MW or
higher then the average MW will be doubled before being added.

Each second there is a red warning light on 100 times the number of red warnings will be deducted
from your score.

Score is only tracked for the first 10 minutes of operation.


Tips:
=====
When everything is operating normally there should be no red warning lights or red buttons.

Before increasing load, move the control rods out so that the primary and secondary temperatures
and pressures are near the top of their range.

Before increasing load, have the Steam Generator levels near the top of their range.

Keep an eye on the Steam Generator levels, these are where most of your problems will be.  Keep
in mind that it takes time for flow rates to build up or reduce, so act well ahead of when you need to.

The maximum power output from the reactor is a little over 600MW

Be sure to adjust the voltage so that the MVAR meter is centered.

If a Steam Generator level hits the high range, use the Steam Dump to dump excess steam.  Be aware that
steam dump will dump steam from all three Steam Generators, for this reason it is a good idea to keep
Steam Generator levels close to each other.

If a Steam Generator level hits the low range, you can use one or both AFP pumps to increase flow more
quickly than just adjusting the feed valves, but keep in mind this will affect the flow for all Steam
Generators, so again try to keep Steam Generator levels close to each other.
